# Security Policy

## General Guidance

We advise users to run the most recent release of the NGINX S3 Gateway, and we issue software updates to the most recent release.

## Support

The NGINX S3 Gateway in and of itself is an unsupported example of a collection of NGINX configuration, containers and njs scripts.
However, NGINX itself is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The F5 Security Incident Response Team (F5 SIRT) has an email alias that makes it easy to report potential security vulnerabilities.

- If you’re an F5 customer with an active support contract, please contact [F5 Technical Support](https://www.f5.com/services/support).
- If you aren’t an F5 customer, please report any potential or current instances of security vulnerabilities with any F5 product to the F5 Security Incident Response Team at F5SIRT@f5.com
