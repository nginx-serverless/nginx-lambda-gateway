代悲白頭翁　　　Lament for the White-Haired Old Man
洛陽城東桃李花　In the east of Luoyang City, Peach blossoms abound
飛來飛去落誰家　Their petals float around, coming and going, to whose house will they fall?
洛陽女児惜顔色　Girls in Luoyang cherish their complexion
行逢落花長歎息　They breathe a deep sigh upon seeing the petals fall
今年花落顔色改　This year the petals fall and their complexion changes
明年花開復誰在　Who will be there when the flowers bloom next year?
已見松柏摧為薪　I've seen the pines and cypresses destroyed and turned into firewood
更聞桑田変成海　I hear that the mulberry fields have fallen into the sea
古人無復洛城東　The people of old never came back to the east of Luoyang City
今人還對落花風　The people of today likewise face the falling flowers in the wind
年年歳歳花相似　Year after year, flowers look alike
歳歳年年人不同　Year after year, the people are not the same
寄言全盛紅顔子　I want you to get this message, my child, you are in your prime, with a rosy complexion
應憐半死白頭翁　Take pity on the half-dead white-haired old man
此翁白頭真可憐　You really must take pity on this white-haired old man
伊昔紅顔美少年　For once upon a time, I used to be a red-faced handsome young man
公子王孫芳樹下　A child of noble birth under a fragrant tree
清歌妙舞落花前　Singing and dancing in front of the falling petals
光禄池臺開錦繍　At the platform before the mirror pond, beautiful autumn leaves opening all around
将軍楼閣畫神仙　The general’s pavilion is painted with gods and goddesses
一朝臥病無相識　Once I was sick and no one knew me
三春行楽在誰邉　Who will be at the shore for the spring outing?
宛轉蛾眉能幾時　For how long will the moths gracefully turn about?
須臾鶴髪亂如絲　The crane’s feathers are like tangled threads for just a moment
但看古来歌舞地　Yet, look at the ancient places of song and dance
惟有黄昏鳥雀悲　Only in twilight, do the birds lament
